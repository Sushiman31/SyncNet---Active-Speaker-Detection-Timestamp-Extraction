# SyncNet---Active-Speaker-Detection-Timestamp-Extraction
This project is a modified version of SyncNet, where the run_visualise.py script has been enhanced to detect active speakers, display real-time visualization, and record their activity timestamps in a JSON file.  These timestamps can be used to extract speakers in dyadic databases.
